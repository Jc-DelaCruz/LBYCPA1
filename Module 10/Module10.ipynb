So far, the functions that we have written accepts only a specific number of inputs (or arguments); that is, the number of arguments that you specify on the definition of the function itself is what the function expects once called.

    "Function objects returned by running `lambda` expressions work exactly the same as those created and assigned by `def`s, but there are a few differences that make `lambda`s useful in specialized roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lambda` is an expression, not a statement. Because of this, a `lambda` can appear in places a `def` is not allowed by Python’s syntax — inside a list literal or a function call’s arguments, for example. As an expression, lambda returns a value (a new function) that can optionally be assigned a name. In contrast, the `def` statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning it as a result.\n",
    "* `lambda`'s body is a single expression, not a block of statements. The `lambda`'s body is similar to what you'd put in a `def` body's return statement; you simply type the result as a naked expression, instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a `lambda` is less general than a `def` — you can only squeeze so much logic into a `lambda` body without using statements such as `if`. This is by design, to limit program nesting: `lambda` is designed for coding simple functions, and `def` handles larger tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from those distinctions, `def`s and `lambda`s do the same sort of work. For instance, we’ve seen how to make a function with a `def` statement:"
